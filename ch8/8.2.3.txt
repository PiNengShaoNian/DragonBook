Generate code for the following three-address sequence assuming that p and q are in memory locations:

y = *q
q = q + 4
*p = y
p = p + 4

LD R0,q           # R0 = q 
LD R1,0(R0)       # R1 = *R0 = *q
ADD R0,R0,#4      # R0 = R0 + 4 = q + 4
ST q,R0           # q = R0 = q + 4
LD R0,p           # R0 = p
ST 0(R0),R1       # *(R0) = *q  ===> *p = y
ADD R0,R0,#4      # R0 = R0 + 4 = p + 4
ST p,R0
