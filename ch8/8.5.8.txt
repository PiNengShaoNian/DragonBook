Suppose a basic block is formed from the C assignment statements

x = a + b + c + d + e + f;
y = a + c + e;

1. Give the three-address statements (only one addition per statement) for this block.
t1 = a + b
t2 = t1 + c
t3 = t2 + d
t4 = t3 + e
t5 = t4 + f
x = t5
t6 = a + c
t7 = c + e
y = t6 + t7

2. optimized statments
t1 = a + c
t2 = t1 + e
y = t2
t3 = t2 + b
t4 = t3 + d
t5 = t4 + f
x = t5
