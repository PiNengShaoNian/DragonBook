For the block-structured code of Fig. 1.14, assuming the usual static scoping of declarations, give the scope for each of the twelve declarations.

Answer
Block B1:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B1-B3-B4
		x				B1-B2-B4
		y				B1-B5
		z				B1-B2-B5
Block B2:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		x				B2-B3
		z				B2
Block B3:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B3
		x				B3
Block B4:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B4
		x				B4
Block B5:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		y				B5
		z				B5
