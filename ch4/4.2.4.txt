There is an extended grammar notation in common use. In this notation, square and curly braces in production bodies are metasymbols (like -> or |) with the following meanings:

Square braces around a grammar symbol or symbols denotes that these constructs are optional. Thus, production A -> X[Y]Z has the same effect as the two productions A -> XYZ and A -> XZ.
Curly braces around a grammar symbol or symbols says that these sym­bols may be repeated any number of times, including zero times. Thus, A -> X{YZ} has the same effect as the infinite sequence of productions A -> X, A -> XYZ, A -> XYZYZ, and so on.
Show that these two extensions do not add power to grammars; that is, any language that can be generated by a grammar with these extensions can be generated by a grammar without the extensions.

A -> X[Y]Z	         A -> XZ | XYZ

A -> X{YZ}           A -> XB
