Use the braces described in Exercise 4.2.4 to simplify the following grammar for statement blocks and conditional statements:

stmt -> if expr then stmt else stmt
      | if stmt them stmt
      | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt; stmtList | stmt


Answer
stmt -> if expr then stmt [else stmt]
      | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt [; stmtList]
