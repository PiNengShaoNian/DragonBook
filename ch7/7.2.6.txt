The C function f is defined by:

int f(int x, *py, **ppz) {
    **ppz += 1;
    *py += 2;
    x += 3;
    return x+y+z;
}
Variable a is a pointer to b; variable b is a pointer to c, and c is an integer currently with value 4. If we call f(c, b, a) , what is returned?

mind that c is passed by value, so the process is:

sentence        x in f()   x out of f()  *py    **ppz
            
**ppz += 1;     4          5             5      5
*py += 2;       4          7             7      7
x += 3;         7          7             7      7
