Suppose we execute Cheney's copying garbage collection al­gorithm on each of the networks of Exercise 7.6.1. Also, suppose that

Each object has size 100 bytes,
The unscanned list is managed as a queue, and when an object has more than one pointer, the reached objects are added to the queue in alpha­ betical order, and
The From semispace starts at location 0, and the To semispace starts at location 10,000.
What is the value of NewLocation(o) for each object o that remains after garbage collection?

Answer
Fig. 7.19 with the pointer A to B deleted.

 A(10000), C(10100), F(10200), H(10300), I(10400), G(10500), E(10600)
