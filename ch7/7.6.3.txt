Suppose we perform a mark-and-compact garbage collection on each of the networks of Exercise 7.6.1. Also, suppose that

Each object has size 100 bytes, and
Initially, the nine objects in the heap are arranged in alphabetical order, starting at byte 0 of the heap.
What is the address of each object after garbage collection?
